# Sample Design Experience

Background: While working at a creative agency, I was asked to quickly develop an internship program for 3 university student interns. Senior Leadership asked for a 10 week program designed to provide computer science majors with hands-on experience in software development. The internship would include mentorship from experienced software developers, training in technical and soft skills, and the opportunity to work on real-world projects. The first week of the 10 week program would be a fun, highly engaging, "deep dive" onboarding experience. The goal was to both generate excitement and train interns on all tools and processes needed for the remaining 9 weeks. 

This sample is _based on_ real work I created for Indigo Slate. 


Task: Design a one week immersive onboarding experience to kick off the internship. The primary goals are to ensure that the new interns feel welcome, are introduced to the company culture, and trained on the tools and processes necessary to operate as a level 1 software engineer. Think "summer camp" for onboarding junior engineers. 


## Process:

  #### 1. Conduct research: 
   - Start by researching best practices for onboarding and gathering information about company culture, values, and processes. 
   - Strategies - surveys, interviews, and focus groups to gather information.

     owner: program lead

  #### 2. Develop learning objectives:
   - Based on research, develop specific learning objectives for the onboarding experience. 
   - These objectives should be measurable and tied to the company's overall goals. 
   - Identify list of core technologies to be introduced during onboarding.
   - Determine what knowledge senior leadership would like interns to have prior to attending first client facing meetings.

     owner: program lead

  #### 2.5 Define Persona(s):
   - Students from the University of Washington's Computer Science Program
   - Junior or Senior level
   - No prior professional or job experience (will likely need hr guidance on tax docs, payroll processes)

     ** In my experience personas are either not used or kept _very_ simple and purely fact based, to avoid biases or unnecessary assumptions. 

     owner: program lead

  #### 3. Create a Schedule Outline (Storyboard):
   - Use the learning objectives to create a schedule that outlines the content and activities that will be included in the onboarding experience. 
   - Include mixed resources for this experience to boost engagement - videos, interactive activities, social gatherings and assessments
   - Ideas: promo videos for clients, game lunch, happy hour tech, shadow meetings, breakout discussions, lunch and learn, last years holiday party talent show clips, 

     owner: program lead + creative

  #### 4. Design a comprehensive visual onboarding schedule document:
   - Use and reference platforms interns will need to learn: Visio, Miro, Teams, Azure Dev Ops, Github
   - Ensure that the document is visually appealing, easy to navigate, and accessible.

     owner: creative

  #### 5. Develop Onboarding Materials: 
   - Develop digital onboarding materials that are engaging, user-friendly, and accessible. 
   - Include points of contact for specific types of questions, room numbers, projector codes
   - Include company required trainings - Sexual Harassment, Security and Compliance, Company Handbook
   - Create assessments for parts of the experience that fulfill learning objectives

     owner: program lead, creative, hr

  #### 6. Conduct a pilot test: (optional) 
  
   - Ideally before launching the full program, conduct a partial pilot test with a new hire to gather feedback and make any necessary adjustments.

     owner: program lead, hr

  #### 7. Launch and Evaluate: 
   - Once the onboarding experience has started, track intern engagement and evaluate the effectiveness of the experience based on the learning objectives.
   - Schedule daily one on ones 
   - Gather daily feedback from shadow mentors

     owner: program lead

  #### 8. Improve and Iterate: 
  
   - Based on the evaluation data, continuously improve the onboarding experience to ensure that it remains effective and engaging for new interns.
   - Make adjustments to account for scalability, and make documentation future proof and easy to update

## Deliverables to Senior Leadership:

 - Onboarding experience design document: A detailed document outlining the new onboarding experience, including learning experiences, onboarding materials, and timelines.
 - Onboarding materials: A suite of engaging, user-friendly, and accessible onboarding materials for new hires.
 - Evaluation: A report summarizing outcomes, feedback gathered and suggested changes based on feedback.


## Notes: 

 - This is just Part 1 of the overall design for the internship. Once developing onboarding is over, there is the entire internship program to design, but because they wanted a big production of this first week, it warranted its own plan. 

 - There are lots of moving parts to oversee and there are incredible resources (very talented writers, designers, creative directors) that are far better suited to create some of these materials than I am. Let them do what they do best, I will provide structure and direction. 

 - Carefully manage time allocation and billable hours for design tasks. Very few billable hours were actually approved for this work. Assign to designers who are between projects, or those with low utilization numbers for the month. 

 - During the program, interns will only be paired with client teams with whom we have good long standing relationships with. There will be no risk to the client with the integration of intern code. All contributions to client applications will be value adds for the client and will not be billed. 

Bonus Points: Designing this experience forced us to review out of date company handbook and training materials and give our new hire onboarding process a revamp. Many of the administrative sections of the intern onboarding experience are applicable to new hires as well.
This overall experience was a pretty big company culture win across teams as well-  nothing renews your excitement for a job like having to create a 5 day immersive experience about how great it is to work at a place. Many of the designers and creative directors said really enjoyed getting to work on this.

Outcomes: We made offers to two of the three interns post graduation. One accepted and one turned us down to go work for HBO. They all had a blast, as did I.
